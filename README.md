## Question 1: What correlations exist between the seasonal migration of college students in Tempe, Arizona, and the occurrence of high severity traffic crashes, and how do the ages of drivers involved in crashes vary across different months of the year?
Understanding how temporal fluctuations in population demographics, such as the seasonal migration of college students, intersect with road safety outcomes in Tempe helps to identify vulnerable age groups and seasonal trends. By identifying these correlations, transportation authorities can develop more effective strategies for mitigating road risks, enhancing safety measures, and ultimately reducing the incidence of high severity traffic crashes throughout the year.

## Question 1 Analysis
The analysis of high severity traffic crashes in Tempe pre-COVID between 2012 and 2019 reveals intriguing seasonal trends. July consistently sees a decrease in crash occurrence, likely influenced by factors such as favorable weather conditions and reduced traffic congestion. Conversely, October shows a notable increase in crashes, potentially due to factors like changing weather conditions, seasonal events, or behavioral shifts post-summer vacations. The analysis of crash data among college-age students in Tempe shows that there's a significant drop in crashes during the summer months, especially in June and July when many students leave the area for summer break. Although crashes also decrease for non-college-age students during summer, the decrease isn't as steep. In the fall, there's a spike in crashes for all age groups, likely due to students returning for the new academic year. Understanding these trends can help authorities plan road safety measures to address fluctuations in crash rates throughout the year.

## Question 2: How does the occurrence of different manners of collisions vary based on driver age in Tempe?
Understanding the age demographics of drivers involved in various collision manners helps identify vulnerable groups. For example, if younger drivers are overrepresented in certain types of collisions, it may indicate a need for targeted interventions such as driver education programs or stricter enforcement of traffic laws.

## Question 2 Analysis 

The analysis of collision manners based on drivers' ages in Tempe shows that drivers in their early 20s are involved in a significant number of collisions. This may be attributed to the demographics of Tempe, Arizona, and the fact that this is a college area. However, when considering the proportions of different collision types and age, there doesn't seem to be a clear link between the type of collision and the age of the driver. This suggests that while younger drivers may be at higher risk overall, the specific type of collision they're involved in isn't strongly influenced by their age. The most common collision manner for most of the ages, though, is rear end. This could possibly be attributed to certain factors like distracted driving and not having enough time to react. Overall, this highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the higher collision rates among younger drivers, while also recognizing that multiple factors contribute to collision outcomes in Tempe.
